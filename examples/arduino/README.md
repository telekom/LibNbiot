# Arduino Example - An example how to use the LibNbiot on an Arduino

This folder contains the python-script **create_arduino_lib.py** that creates a LibNbiot.zip that can be imported as 
a library by the Arduino IDE (version 1.8.5. required). The imported library ships with two easy-to-use example called
**ArduinoMegaExample** and **Tuino096Example**. 

## Hardware Prerequisites

So far, the library was tested succesfully on an Arduino Mega and Tuino096. Other AVR-µC as well as SAMD-µC should also work but make sure that that 
these µC have at least two hardware serial interfaces (one for communication with the modem, one for debug outputs) 
and enough SRAM.

##### ArduinoMegaExample
Connect the UART TX/RX pins of a compatible NB-IoT modem to the UART RX/TX (19,18) pins of the Arduino Mega.
##### Tuino096Example
On the Tuino096 Board the appropriate pins of the Modem are already connected to the µC. Please make sure that you configure your modem correctly and try to attach it to the network before running the example.

In addition the modem has to be equipped with a **SIM card** which is registered for the **Telekom Cloud of Things**. 

## Software Prerequisites

In additional to LibNbiot, you will need other librariries for serial communication and timer setting in order to get the examples running.

For **ArduinoMegaExample** you need:
* Serial 
* TimerOne

For **Tuino096Example** you need:
* RTCZero
* Adafruit_ZeroTimer

Please make sure that you choose module/firmware version *BG96MA-R02A07M1G* for the library if you use **Tuino096Example**.

## Starting the example

Execute the python-script. You will get a prompt to choose the module/firmware you want to use:

    --- Available firmwares:
    ---  1: SARA-N2XX-B657SP3   
    ---  2: SARA-N2XX-B656
    ---  3: BG96MA-R02A07M1G      
    
    --- Enter firmware index: 
 
The script will create a LibNbiot[xxx].zip-library for the specified module/firmware. [xxx] is replaced by the specific module/firmware.

Open the Arduino IDE and import the newly created LibNbiot[xxx].zip-library. Open
one of the given examples: **ArduinoMegaExample**, **Tuino096Example**. Change the following Makros:

    #define AUTH_IMSI "111111111111111"
    #define AUTH_PWD "PASSWORD"

Replace `111111111111111` by a 15-digit IMSI which is registered for the Telekom Cloud of Things and
replace `PASSWORD` by the 8-characters password distributed with IMSI for Telekom Cloud Things access.

Compile the code and flash it to the Arduiono. Open the Serial Monitor to observe Debug Outputs.
